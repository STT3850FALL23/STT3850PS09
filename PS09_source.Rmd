# Background

First load the necessary packages:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
```

For this Problem Set, you will work with some grade-point-average (GPA) data for college freshman. The following will read in the data:

```{r, label = "satgpa", fig.cap = "SAT versus GPA data"}
if(!dir.exists("./Data")){
  dir.create("./Data")
  }
url <- "https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS220/static/PS/sat_gpa.csv"
if(!file.exists("./Data/sat_gpa.csv")){ 
  download.file(url, destfile = "./Data/sat_gpa.csv")
  }
sat_gpa <- read_csv("./Data/sat_gpa.csv")
DT::datatable(sat_gpa, rownames = FALSE)
```

Be sure to take a look at the data in Figure \@ref(fig:satgpa). Each row or case in this data frame is a student. The data includes the (binary) gender of each student; the math, verbal and total SAT scores for each student; the GPA of each student in high school (categorized as "low" or "high"); and the GPA of each student their first year of college on a numeric scale.


We will use hypothesis testing to answer the following questions:

*  Is there a difference in male and female freshman GPAs?
*  Is there a difference in total SAT score for students with a "low" and "high" high-school GPA?

Note, if you get stuck as you are working through this, it will be helpful to go back and read Chapter 10 in ModernDive.

# Gender Differences in First-Year GPA?

## Exploratory Data Analysis

__________

1. Calculate the mean GPA score for each gender, using the `group_by` and `summarize` commands from the `dplyr` package.  Store the result in `avg_gpa_sex`.  What is the difference in sample mean GPA's? Make a guess: is this difference statistically significant?

## Stating a Null Hypothesis

We will now test the null hypothesis that there's no difference in population mean GPA between the genders at the population level. We can write this out in mathematical notation 

$$\begin{aligned} H_0:&\mu_{female} = \mu_{male} \\\ \mbox{vs }H_A:& \mu_{female} \neq \mu_{male} \end{aligned}$$

or expressed differently, that the difference is 0 or not:

$$\begin{aligned} H_0:&\mu_{female} - \mu_{male} = 0 \\\ \mbox{vs }H_A:& \mu_{female} - \mu_{male} \neq 0 \end{aligned}$$

## Testing the Hypothesis

Here's how we use infer to run this hypothesis test:

### Step 1: Calculate the Observed Difference{-} 

Note that the order we choose does not matter here (female then male)...but since we used `order = c("Female", "Male")` here, we should do the same in subsequent calculations!

```{r}
obs_diff_gpa_sex <- sat_gpa %>% 
  specify(gpa_fy ~ sex) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Female", "Male")) %>% 
  pull()

obs_diff_gpa_sex
```

Note that this is the difference in the group means we calculated earlier!

```{r}
obs_diff_gpa_sex
2.544587 - 2.396066

```

### Step 2. Generate the Null Distribution of $\delta$ {-}

This step involves generating simulated values *as if* we lived in a world where there's no difference between the two groups. Going back to the idea of permutation, and tactile sampling, this is akin to shuffling the GPA scores between male and female labels (i.e. removing the structure to the data) just as we could have done with index cards. 

```{r}
gpas_in_null_world <- sat_gpa %>% 
  specify(gpa_fy ~ sex) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 2000, type = "permute")
```

### Step 3. Calculate the Differences Between Male and Females Under the Null Hypothesis{-}

The following calculates the differences in mean GPA for males and females for "shuffled" (permuted) data. 

```{r}
gpa_diff_under_null <- gpas_in_null_world %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Female", "Male")) 

gpa_diff_under_null %>% 
  slice(1:5) # show first five rows
```

______________

### Step 4. Visualize how the Observed Difference Compares to the Null Distribution of $\delta$ {-}

The following plots the $\delta$ values we calculated for each of the different "shuffled" replicates. This is the null distribution of $\delta$. The red line shows the observed difference between male and female scores in the data from step 1. 

```{r}
gpa_diff_under_null %>% 
  visualize() +
  labs(x = "Difference in mean GPA for males and females", y = "Count",
       title = "Null distribution of differences in male and female GPAs",
      subtitle = "Actual difference observed in the data is marked in red") + 
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_gpa_sex, direction = "two-sided") +
  theme_bw()
```

**Note that zero is the center of this null distribution.** The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between males and females in GPA score. In the permutations, zero was the most common value, because all structure was removed from the data...GPA values were sorted into male and female **at random**. Values as large as ~ 0.1 and -0.1 occurred, but much less frequently, because they are just not as likely when structure is removed from the data.  


### Step 5: Calculate a p-value{-}

```{r}
gpa_diff_under_null %>% 
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = obs_diff_gpa_sex, direction = "both") %>%   pull() -> pvalue
pvalue
```

This result indicates that there is a `r pvalue` chance (very low) that we would see a difference of `r obs_diff_gpa_sex` in GPA scores between males and females (or a bigger difference) if in fact there was truly no difference between the sexes in GPA scores at the population level.

6. Fill in the blanks below to write up the results & conclusions for this test:

The mean GPA scores for females in our sample ($\bar{x}$ = ______) was greater than that of males ($\bar{x}$ = ______). This difference __(was/was not)___ statistically significant at  $\alpha = 0.05$, (p = _______).  Given this I __(would/would not)__ reject the Null hypothesis and conclude that _____ have higher GPAs than _____ at the population level.

</div> 



_______________

### Step 6: Calculate a Confidence Interval for the Difference{-}

The following will allow us to calculate a 95% bootstrap percentile confidence interval for the difference between mean GPA scores for females and males. 

```{r}
ci_diff_gpa_means <- sat_gpa %>% 
  specify(gpa_fy ~ sex) %>%
  generate(reps = 2000) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Female", "Male")) %>% 
  get_ci(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
ci_diff_gpa_means
```

## Complete all the Above Tasks with a t-test{-}

Note that all the above steps can be done with one line of code **if a slew of assumptions** like normality and equal variance of the groups are met. 

```{r}
t.test(gpa_fy ~ sex, var.equal = TRUE, data = sat_gpa)
```

___________



# Relationship Between High-School & First-Year GPA?

For this analysis `sat_total` is the outcome variable, and `gpa_hs` is the predictor variable, with two levels "low" and "high". 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We can first calculate the mean total SAT score for each group (i.e students with a low and high GPA), using the `group_by` and `summarize` commands from the `dplyr` package. 

```{r}
avg_sat_gpa <- sat_gpa %>% 
  group_by(gpa_hs) %>% 
  summarize(sat_total = mean(sat_total))

avg_sat_gpa
```

We will next generate a data visualization that displays the total SAT scores of the two groups. Be sure to include a title and label your axes. 

```{r}
ggplot(sat_gpa, aes(x = gpa_hs, y = sat_total)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "darkgreen") + 
  labs(title = "SAT scores based on high school GPA scores", 
       x = "GPA ranking", y = "SAT score") + 
  theme_bw()
```
